## Description
Mapping data into components involves iterating over a dataset (e.g., an array) and dynamically generating a set of React components based on the data. This allows you to render lists or repeat similar UI elements, such as creating a list of items or displaying multiple cards based on a collection of objects. The map() method is often used for this purpose, where each piece of data is transformed into a React component.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
2. Start the frontend application locally
```bash
npm start
```
